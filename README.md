# Analysis of Global Population Growth
From 1970 to 2023, the world population experienced a remarkable increase, rising from 3.7 billion to 8 billion inhabitants, representing an addition of 4.3 billion people over this period.

## Global Trends
The average annual population growth worldwide during this interval was approximately 81.132 million people per year. If we look at the average per decade, this number increases to approximately 811.321 million people per decade. These data highlight the significant demographic expansion that has occurred in recent decades.

However, a more detailed analysis reveals an interesting trend. While the absolute number of inhabitants continues to grow, the percentage growth rate per person has been decreasing over time.

## Changes in Growth Rate
For example, in the period from 1970 to 1980, the world population increased from 3.6 billion to 4.4 billion, representing an addition of 800 million inhabitants. This implies an average growth of approximately 80 million per year, considering the starting point of 3.6 billion.

When examining the most recent data, such as from 2022 to 2023, we notice that the average remains similar, going from 7.9 billion to 8 billion in just one year. However, the current number of inhabitants is nearly double what it was in the 1970s. This observation leads us to question whether, proportionally, the growth should be twice that observed at that time.

## Challenges and Reflections
This realization leads us to a crucial question: is there a maximum sustainable limit of inhabitants on the planet? If the answer is affirmative, what would that limit be? This question is complex, involving not only demographic aspects but also environmental, economic, and social considerations.

The search for answers to this question is vital for future planning and the sustainability of our planet. The balance between population growth and available resources becomes a global challenge that requires reflection and careful actions.

As we continue to explore and present demographic and geographic data, as in the "Povoando o Planeta" project, it is essential to consider not only the past and present but also the future. Only through understanding these trends and challenges can we collaborate in building a sustainable future for future generations.
